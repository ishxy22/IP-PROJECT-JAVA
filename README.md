## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project is separated into two main components: a backend REST API and a frontend client.

| Component | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | **Java 11** | Core programming language. |
| | **Spring Boot 2.7.5** | Framework for creating the robust RESTful API. |
| | **Spring Data JPA** | For data persistence and repository management. |
| | **Spring Web** | For building web-based controllers. |
| | **Maven** | Dependency management and project build. |
| **Database** | **H2 In-Memory** | Lightweight, in-memory database for development. |
| **Frontend**| **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** | For all client-side logic, API fetching, and DOM manipulation. |
| | **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. |
| | **AOS (Animate on Scroll)** | For subtle scroll animations. |
| | **jsPDF & html2canvas** | For client-side PDF generation. |
| **APIs** | **Groq API (Llama 3.1)** | External API for AI-powered suggestions. |

-----

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * **Java 11** (JDK 11)
  * **Maven** (can use the included Maven Wrapper `mvnw`)
  * A **Groq API Key** for AI features.
  * A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
  * A tool to run a local server for the frontend (like the **Live Server** extension for VS Code).

### Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```sh
    cd TravelPlanner-Backend
    ```

3.  **Run the application using the Maven Wrapper:**

      * On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        ./mvnw spring-boot:run
        ```
      * On Windows:
        ```sh
        .\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
        ```

4.  **Backend is now running\!**

      * The API will be live at `http://localhost:8080`.
      * You can access the H2 in-memory database console at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`.
      * **H2 Console Settings:**
          * **Driver Class:** `org.h2.Driver`
          * **JDBC URL:** `jdbc:h2:mem:travel_planner_db`
          * **User Name:** `sa`
          * **Password:** `password`

### Frontend Setup (Vanilla JS)

1.  **Get your Groq API Key:**

      * Go to the [Groq website](https://groq.com/) and sign up to get a free API key.

2.  **Add the API Key:**

      * Open the `TravelPlanner-Frontend/index.html` file.
      * Find the following line in the `<script>` tag at the bottom:
        ```javascript
        const GROQ_API_KEY = "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"; // IMPORTANT: Replace with your Groq API key
        ```
      * Replace `"YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"` with your actual Groq key.

3.  **Run the frontend:**

      * The backend's CORS policy is configured to accept requests from `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.
      * The easiest way to run the frontend is using the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code.
      * Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
      * This will automatically open the application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.

4.  **All set\!** You can now use the application.

## üóÑÔ∏è API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following RESTful endpoints under the base URL `http://localhost:8080/api/itineraries`.

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Request Body (JSON) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/` | Fetches all saved itineraries. | None |
| `POST` | `/` | Saves a new itinerary. | `Itinerary` object |
| `DELETE`| `/{id}` | Deletes an itinerary by its ID. | None |

### `Itinerary` Model

The `Itinerary` object has the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1, // Auto-generated
  "destination": "Swiss Alps",
  "startDate": "2024-12-20",
  "endDate": "2024-12-25",
  "dayPlans": "[{\"date\":\"2024-12-20\",\"activities\":[{\"time\":\"09:00\",\"description\":\"Arrive in Zurich\"}]}]" // JSON string
}
```
